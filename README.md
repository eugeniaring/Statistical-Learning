# Predicting Bike Renting Demand 

Using different algorithms such as Multiple Linear Regression, Poisson Regression, Random Forest, Knn, XGBoost 
to train our model and predict the count of bikes rented using a test set.
The dataset is available in the website https://www.kaggle.com/bike-sharing-dataset

Steps:

1. Exploratory Analysis
2. Trained models: 

* Multiple linear regression with Log response
* Poisson Regression 
* Random Forest 
* k Nearest Neighbors 
* XGBoost
* GAM 

3. Assess/evaluate trained model performance
